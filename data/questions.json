      "solutionExplanation": "The poor harvest shifts the supply curve left. At the initial price, quantity supplied falls, creating excess demand. A new equilibrium is established at a higher price and lower quantity. Consumers face higher prices and potential shortages while producers supply less."

      "solutionExplanation": "Expansionary fiscal policy increases aggregate demand, shifting the AD curve to the right. Starting from a recessionary gap, this brings the economy closer to potential output. Real GDP rises and the price level may increase slightly depending on the slope of the AS curve."
