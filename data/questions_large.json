Years of chronic fiscal deficits, money printing, and loss of confidence in the peso culminated in runaway price increases. The newly elected government under Javier Milei inherited a rapidly deteriorating economy. To stabilise the situation, the administration implemented austerity measures, devalued the peso, and sought support from the International Monetary Fund. These policies aimed to reduce the fiscal deficit and restore credibility, but they also risked deepening recession and social unrest. Many Argentines saw their real incomes erode as wages lagged behind soaring prices. Poverty rates climbed above 40%. The central bank hiked interest rates above 130% to stem capital flight, while the government cut energy subsidies to reduce spending. Businesses struggled to set prices and plan investment amidst volatile exchange rates. Meanwhile, foreign investors remained cautious until reforms showed results.",

Despite inflation climbing towards 80%, the central bank pursued unorthodox monetary policy by cutting interest rates under pressure from President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, who argued that lower rates would spur growth and exports. The lira lost more than half its value against the US dollar within a year, raising the cost of imported goods and fuelling further inflation. Households saw their purchasing power erode as food and energy prices surged. Many Turks sought refuge in foreign currencies and gold to protect their savings. To stabilise the exchange rate, the government introduced a deposit protection scheme that compensated savers for lira depreciation and sold billions of dollars in reserves. While these measures slowed the lira\u2019s fall, they also depleted foreign reserves and increased fiscal risk. Meanwhile, exporters enjoyed a temporary competitiveness boost from the weaker lira, but rising input costs and uncertainty offset these gains. The crisis highlighted the trade\u2011offs between growth, inflation control, and currency stability.",

The lack of foreign currency led to shortages of fuel, medicine and essential goods. Long queues formed at petrol stations, and power cuts became frequent. Inflation surged above 50%.

      "backgroundText": "Nigeria has long subsidised petrol prices, making fuel artificially cheap. However, the subsidy has strained public finances, costing billions of dollars annually and contributing to fiscal deficits. In May 2023, the newly elected government abruptly removed the subsidy. The price of petrol more than tripled overnight, rising from about 200 naira per litre to over 600 naira. Transportation and food costs increased rapidly, pushing inflation higher and reducing real incomes for many Nigerians. Protesters took to the streets, and labour unions called for strikes. The government argued that removing the subsidy would free resources for investment in infrastructure and social programmes. It also aimed to curb smuggling of subsidised fuel to neighbouring countries. To ease the transition, authorities pledged to provide cash transfers to vulnerable households and to invest in public transport. The policy sparked debate about the best way to reform subsidies while protecting the poor and maintaining macroeconomic stability.",

Natural gas supplies from Russia plummeted as pipelines were shut down or sabotaged. Gas prices in Europe skyrocketed to more than ten times their long\u2011term average. Electricity prices followed suit. Countries like Germany, Italy and Hungary scrambled to secure alternative supplies, importing liquefied natural gas (LNG) from the United States, Qatar and others. Governments introduced price caps and subsidies to shield households and businesses from soaring bills. The EU agreed to joint gas procurement and set targets to fill storage. High energy costs pushed inflation to record levels and threatened industrial competitiveness. Some energy\u2011intensive factories curtailed production or shut down. At the same time, the crisis accelerated investments in renewables and energy efficiency. Households cut consumption by lowering thermostats and reducing use. The crisis underscored Europe\u2019s dependency on Russian gas and the need for a transition to more secure and sustainable energy sources.",

      "backgroundText": "In 2022, China continued to enforce a strict zero\u2011COVID policy aimed at eradicating the virus. Cities like Shanghai and Shenzhen were placed under lockdown for weeks after outbreaks. Factories and ports operated at reduced capacity or were temporarily shut down. These measures disrupted global supply chains. Lead times for electronics, garments and machinery lengthened as shipments were delayed. Multinational companies re\u2011evaluated their reliance on Chinese manufacturing and considered diversifying production to other countries. China\u2019s domestic economy also slowed. Consumption weakened as residents were confined to their homes. Youth unemployment rose to record levels. Although the government introduced stimulus measures and infrastructure spending, the uncertainty around lockdowns dampened private investment. In late 2022, China began to relax restrictions amid mounting economic costs and social discontent, raising hopes for a rebound in 2023.",

      "backgroundText": "On 1 October 2022, Germany raised its statutory minimum wage from \u20ac10.45 to \u20ac12 per hour, a 15% increase. The policy aimed to improve living standards for low\u2011income workers and reduce in\u2011work poverty. It followed earlier increases in 2019 and 2021. Supporters argued that higher wages would boost consumption and productivity by motivating workers. Critics warned that small businesses might struggle to absorb higher labour costs, leading to reduced hiring or higher prices. Early data showed limited employment effects, but it was too soon to assess long\u2011term impacts. The increase came amid high inflation driven by energy costs. Real wage growth remained modest, and unions demanded further rises. The government considered targeted tax relief to support small firms. The policy sparked debate about the balance between social protection and labour market flexibility.",

Many borrowers are women running small businesses such as grocery shops and craft workshops.

The programme also aims to increase women\u2019s labour force participation, improve education and attract foreign investment. To fund these initiatives, the state partially privatised Saudi Aramco and introduced new taxes like VAT.
