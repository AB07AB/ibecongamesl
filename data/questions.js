Years of chronic fiscal deficits, money printing, and loss of confidence in the peso culminated in runaway price increases. The newly elected government under Javier Milei inherited a rapidly deteriorating economy. To stabilise the situation, the administration implemented austerity measures, devalued the peso, and sought support from the International Monetary Fund. These policies aimed to reduce the fiscal deficit and restore credibility, but they also risked deepening recession and social unrest. Many Argentines saw their real incomes erode as wages lagged behind soaring prices. Poverty rates climbed above 40%. The central bank hiked interest rates above 130% to stem capital flight, while the government cut energy subsidies to reduce spending. Businesses struggled to set prices and plan investment amidst volatile exchange rates. Meanwhile, foreign investors remained cautious until reforms showed results.",

Despite inflation climbing towards 80%, the central bank pursued unorthodox monetary policy by cutting interest rates under pressure from President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, who argued that lower rates would spur growth and exports. The lira lost more than half its value against the US dollar within a year, raising the cost of imported goods and fuelling further inflation. Households saw their purchasing power erode as food and energy prices surged. Many Turks sought refuge in foreign currencies and gold to protect their savings. To stabilise the exchange rate, the government introduced a deposit protection scheme that compensated savers for lira depreciation and sold billions of dollars in reserves. While these measures slowed the lira\u2019s fall, they also depleted foreign reserves and increased fiscal risk. Meanwhile, exporters enjoyed a temporary competitiveness boost from the weaker lira, but rising input costs and uncertainty offset these gains.

Transportation and food costs increased rapidly, pushing inflation higher and reducing real incomes for many Nigerians. Protesters took to the streets, and labour unions called for strikes. The government argued that removing the subsidy would free resources for investment in infrastructure and social programmes. It also aimed to curb smuggling of subsidised fuel to neighbouring countries. To ease the transition, authorities pledged to provide cash transfers to vulnerable households and to invest in public transport.

Electricity prices followed suit. Countries like Germany, Italy and Hungary scrambled to secure alternative supplies, importing liquefied natural gas (LNG) from the United States, Qatar and others. Governments introduced price caps and subsidies to shield households and businesses from soaring bills. The EU agreed to joint gas procurement and set targets to fill storage. High energy costs pushed inflation to record levels and threatened industrial competitiveness. Some energy\u2011intensive factories curtailed production or shut down. At the same time, the crisis accelerated investments in renewables and energy efficiency. Households cut consumption by lowering thermostats and reducing use.

In 2019, institutions like Banco Compartamos and Grameen Mexico expanded their outreach to rural and urban poor. These lenders offer small loans, savings accounts and insurance products to individuals who lack access to traditional banking. By 2019, Mexico had over 7 million microcredit clients. Many borrowers are women running small businesses such as grocery shops and craft workshops. Microfinance is credited with empowering women, increasing household consumption and smoothing income fluctuations. However, critics argue that high interest rates (often above 50%) can trap borrowers in cycles of debt. There are concerns about over\u2011lending and aggressive collection practices. Policymakers are debating regulation to protect consumers while preserving access to credit.",
